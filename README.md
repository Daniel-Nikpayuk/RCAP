RCAP
=====

Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP) Audio!

The RCAP is a 1996 five volume report looking at the history of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples and Canada.
The kind of history which isn't taught in Canadian history books, but should be.

*Aboriginal Voices Radio* had originally recorded audio readings of the entire RCAP report. Their original work was here:

Unfortunately that link is now broken. Online [textual versions](http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1307458586498/1307458751962)
are still maintained by the federal government, but as text alone may not be ideal or preferred by some, I have for extended
accessibility archived the audio provided by Aboriginal Voices Radio (over 3GB). The audio is split into the five volumes,
and is available below:
